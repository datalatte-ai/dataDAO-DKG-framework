# Description
 streamlined framework for DataDAO members to create and share knowledge about their on-chain activities and opinions, stored in a mix of public and private domains. This allows knowledge seekers to easily identify and access tailored information from selected DataDAO profiles. They can also pay for deeper insights or request additional data through surveys or interviews.

## Milestones & timeline
### Milestone 1: Detailed specifications 
#### Timeline: 15th Jan 2024

### Milestone 2: Public profile (KAs) publishing & Knowledge extraction pipeline, testnet
#### Timeline: 15th Feb 2024

### Milestone 3: Private knowledge publishing via dataDAO's node
#### Timeline: 15th March 2024


## Expected Impact:
Leveraging DKG as the foundational data model and storage mechanism, our DataDAO framework empowers additional dataDAOs to utilize this infrastructure. This approach not only stimulates demand for Knowledge Assets publishing but also fosters a crowdsourced mechanism for populating the DKG. This collaborative effort effectively bridges knowledge gaps within the DKG. 
Furthermore, the primary focus of datalatte DataDAO lies in exploring the relationship between on-chain and off-chain data, a topic that has garnered significant interest among Web3 market researchers.

## Future plans
In this proposal, our primary objective is to emphasize the dataDAO onboarding framework, aligning it with the knowledge mining initiative spearheaded by Nueroweb. As we work towards achieving these milestones, we are planning a launch for our private alpha users in January 2024 & gradually introducing the milestones in our dApp. Moreover, we see a potential to add further enrichment of CommunityKG by adding public information about web3 topics & projects by users, further completing the CommunityKG.

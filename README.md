# Description
A knowledge mining framework designed for DataDAO members, enabling them to create, publish, and enrich knowledge surrounding their on-chain behaviors and opinions. This knowledge is stored in a hybrid environment, comprising both public and private knowledge. This structure allows knowledge buyers to browse the public profiles of DataDAO members, aiding them in identifying a target audience that aligns with their research requirements. Upon finding the appropriate audience, they can then pay to access a curated and enriched private knowledge, specific to that group. Additionally, we will provide an option for knowledge buyers to request further data directly from DataDAO members, which could be in the form of surveys, interviews, and other interactive methods.

The knowledge is stored in a hybrid of public & private, so that knowledge buyers can browse through the public profile of the dataDAO members and find the target audience in which satisfies their research, and pay to access the curated & enriched knowledge around the target audience & request for futher data from the dataDAO members in terms of surveys, interview, etc.

### Milestone 3: Community's KAs curation & enrichment
#### Timeline: 15th March 2024

## Expected Impact:
Leveraging DKG as the foundational data model and storage mechanism, our DataDAO framework empowers additional dataDAOs to utilize this infrastructure. This approach not only stimulates demand for Knowledge Assets publishing but also fosters a crowdsourced mechanism for populating the DKG. This collaborative effort effectively bridges knowledge gaps within the DKG. 
Furthermore, the primary focus of datalatte DataDAO lies in exploring the relationship between on-chain and off-chain data, a topic that has garnered significant interest among Web3 market researchers.
